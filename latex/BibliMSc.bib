abstract = {This report discusses the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including incidence and prevalence, mortality rates, costs of care, and overall effect on caregivers and society. It also examines the impact of AD on women compared with men. An estimated 5.2 million Americans have AD. Approximately 200,000 people younger than 65 years with AD comprise the younger onset AD population; 5 million are age 65 years or older. By mid-century, fueled in large part by the baby boom generation, the number of people living with AD in the United States is projected to grow by about 9 million. Today, someone in the country develops AD every 67 seconds. By 2050, one new case of AD is expected to develop every 33 seconds, or nearly a million new cases per year, and the total estimated prevalence is expected to be 13.8 million. In 2010, official death certificates recorded 83,494 deaths from AD, making AD the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death in Americans aged 65 years or older. Between 2000 and 2010, the proportion of deaths resulting from heart disease, stroke, and prostate cancer decreased 16{\%}, 23{\%}, and 8{\%}, respectively, whereas the proportion resulting from AD increased 68{\%}. The actual number of deaths to which AD contributes (or deaths with AD) is likely much larger than the number of deaths from AD recorded on death certificates. In 2014, an estimated 700,000 older Americans will die with AD, and many of them will die from complications caused by AD. In 2013, more than 15 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 17.7 billion hours of care to people with AD and other dementias, a contribution valued at more than {\$}220 billion. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries aged 65 years and older with AD and other dementias are more than two and a half times as great as payments for all beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are 19 times as great. Total payments in 2014 for health care, long-term care, and hospice services for people aged 65 years and older with dementia are expected to be {\$}214 billion. AD takes a stronger toll on women than men. More women than men develop the disease, and women are more likely than men to be informal caregivers for someone with AD or another dementia. As caregiving responsibilities become more time consuming and burdensome or extend for prolonged durations, women assume an even greater share of the caregiving burden. For every man who spends 21 to more than 60 hours per week as a caregiver, there are 2.1 women. For every man who lives with the care recipient and provides around-the-clock care, there are 2.5 women. In addition, for every man who has provided caregiving assistance for more than 5 years, there are 2.3 women. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Alzheimers Association. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Smart mobile devices have fostered new interaction scenarios that demand sophisticated interfaces. The main developers of operating systems for such devices provide APIs for developers to implement their own applications, including different solutions for graphical interfaces, sensor control, and voice interaction. Despite the usefulness of such resources, there are no strategies defined for coupling the multimodal interface with the possibilities that the devices offer to identify and adapt to the user needs, which is particularly important in domains such as Ambient Assisted Living. In this paper, we propose a framework that allows developing context-aware multimodal conversational agents that dynamically incorporate user-specific requirements and preferences as well as characteristics about the interaction environment, in order to improve and personalize the service that is provided. Our proposal integrates the facilities of the Android API in a modular architecture that emphasizes interaction management and context-awareness to build user-adapted, robust and maintainable applications. As a proof of concept, we have used the proposed framework to develop an Android app for older adults suffering from Alzheimer's. The app helps them to preserve their cognitive abilities and enhance their relationship with their environment.},

abstract = {Purpose:Localization-based technologies promise to keep older adults with dementia safe and support them and their caregivers during getting lost events. This paper summarizes mainly technological contributions to support the target group in these events. Moreover, important aspects of the getting lost phenomenon such as its concept and ethical issues are also briefly addressed. Methods:Papers were selected from scientific databases and gray literature. Since the topic is still in its infancy, other terms were used to find contributions associated with getting lost e.g. wandering. Results:Trends of applying localization systems were identified as personal locators, perimeter systems and assistance systems. The first system barely considered the older adult's opinion, while assistance systems may involve context awareness to improve the support for both the elderly and the caregiver. Since few studies report multidisciplinary work with a special focus on getting lost, there is not a strong evidence of the real efficiency of localization systems or guidelines to design systems for the target group. Conclusions:Further research about getting lost is required to obtain insights for developing customizable systems. Moreover, considering conditions of the older adult might increase the impact of developments that combine localization technologies and artificial intelligence techniques.Implications for RehabilitationWhilst there is no cure for dementia such as Alzheimer's, it is feasible to take advantage of technological developments to somewhat diminish its negative impact. For instance, location-based systems may provide information to early diagnose the Alzheimer's disease by assessing navigational impairments of older adults.Assessing the latest supportive technologies and methodologies may provide insights to adopt strategies to properly manage getting lost events.More user-centered designs will provide appropriate assistance to older adults. Namely, customizable systems could assist older adults in their daily walks with the aim to increase their self-confidence, independence and autonomy.},

This paper presents results on the use and adoption of an assisted cognition system to support occupational therapy to address psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. During 16 weeks, we conducted an in situ evaluation with two caregiver-PwD dyads to assess the adoption and effectiveness of the system to ameliorate challenging behaviors and reducing caregiver burden.

The means by which to make effective use of this information and these services to benefit the driver and improve road safety is very important in an intelligent transportation system. This research aims to describe the design and implementation of a context-aware ser-vice system for perceiving the driving situation and providing the most appropriate function or information services to address the actual needs in a driving assistance environment. To describe various hazardous situations, the status-emphasized context model and reasoning rules are proposed to abstract the context information and facilitate better understanding the driver's context. The approach of customized service invocation is proposed by the retrieval of the service configuration model, which builds the relationship between the driver's status and appropriate business services. In addition, to address the situations with multiple hazards, a priority-and severity-based invocation control algorithm is proposed; through this algorithm, the invocation procedure can be determined based on the priority and severity of the hazards. An evaluation based on computational experiments is conducted to verify the availability and validity of the ser-vice system.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t At present, in most context-aware systems, decisions on when and how to adapt an application are made a priori by developers during the compile time. While such approaches empower developers with sufficient flexibility to specify what they want in terms of adaptation rules, they inevitably place an immense load on developers, especially in an extremely dynamic environment, to anticipate and formulate all potential run-time situations during development time. These challenges motivated us to explore an approach to automating context-aware adaptation decisions by a middleware layer at run time. The resulting middleware, CAMPUS, exploits technologies from semantic computing to dynamically derive adaptation decisions according to run-time contextual information. The CAMPUS implementation has been evaluated with a number of case applications to validate the operation of the system in a realistic environment and to provide us with an opportunity to obtain experimental results for further analysis. The results are significant in that they show that CAMPUS can effectively free developers from the need to predict, formulate, and maintain adaptation rules, thereby greatly reducing the efforts required to develop context-aware applications.},

@article{Li2017,
abstract = {Ontologies have been widely used to facilitate semantic interoperability and serve as a common information model in many applications or domains. The Smart and Networking Underwater Robots in Cooperation Meshes (SWARMs) project, aiming to facilitate coordination and cooperation between heterogeneous underwater vehicles, also adopts ontologies to formalize information that is necessarily exchanged between vehicles. However, how to derive more useful contexts based on ontologies still remains a challenge. In particular, the extreme nature of the underwater environment introduces uncertainties in context data, thus imposing more difficulties in context reasoning. None of the existing context reasoning methods could individually deal with all intricacies in the underwater robot field. To this end, this paper presents the first proposal applying a hybrid context reasoning mechanism that includes ontological, rule-based, and Multi-Entity Bayesian Network (MEBN) reasoning methods to reason about contexts and their uncertainties in the underwater robot field. The theoretical foundation of applying this reasoning mechanism in underwater robots is given by a case study on the oil spill monitoring. The simulated reasoning results are useful for further decision-making by operators or robots and they show that the consolidation of different reasoning methods is a promising approach for context reasoning in underwater robots.},

abstract = {Context awareness is a key feature of adaptive applications and services developed on a ubiquitous computing infrastructure. Typical middlewares for managing context information rely on a centralized server to receive, process and deliver context information. However, such an approach has many drawbacks. Among them, we can mention that rule based reasoning is not fl exible at all. In this paper, a framework for the management of context information is presented. It is based on Semantic Web technologies for the rep- resentation of context, reasoning and inferencing over such information. The particularity of the pre sented framework is that it is distributed. The Semantic Web based ontology is partially distributed, being the rule sets used for personalized context reasoning and inferencing spread over the context information consumers. With such an approach, adaptive services and applications in ubiquitous computing scenarios can be developed easily. As a consequence, this framework paves the way for more powerful, fl exible and easy to develop and deploy adaptive ubiquitous computing applications.},

@article{Cabrera2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany Context-aware computing is the ability of Services and applications to adapt and react to context changes. Context modelling is a core feature of context-aware computing. Although a lot of research has been made in the field of context modelling, most of the context-aware computing proposals prefer to design their own customized context model instead of reusing an existing one. The main reason for this behaviour is that current context models present some problems concerning reusability, extensibility and adaptation. To contribute solving these issues, in this paper we present 3LConOnt, a three-level context ontology that can be easily reused, extended and adapted for specific or generic purposes. The proposed context model consolidates the context knowledge already available from a modular perspective yielding a clear schema of knowledge reutilization. To do so, we gathered context knowledge pieces from different ontologies to be integrated into standardized and well-defined levels of abstraction and modules. The proposal has been validated considering: (1) reusability, extensibility and adaptation by instantiating different smart scenarios; (2) consistency and reasoning by triggering queries to the proposed model based on some competence questions; and (3) reusability in existing ontologies by importing the needed module or level of the model. Additionally, we also illustrate its usability in context-aware Services by modelling a context-aware framework architecture for supporting the whole context life cycle: acquisition, modelling, reasoning and distribution.},

However, the complex nature of human behavior demands more abstract contextual information for its analysis. This work presents an ontology-based method that combines low-level primitives of behavior, namely activity, locations and emotions, unprecedented to date, to intelligently derive more meaningful high-level context information. The paper contributes with a new open ontology describing both low-level and high-level context information, as well as their relationships. Furthermore, a framework building on the developed ontology and reasoning models is presented and evaluated. The proposed method proves to be robust while identifying high-level contexts even in the event of erroneously-detected low-level contexts. Despite reasonable inference times being obtained for a relevant set of users and instances, additional work is required to scale to long-term scenarios with a large number of users.},

This investigation aims to chart the challenges to take advantage of the dynamic varying context information, and provide solutions to customize the computing service to the contextual situations. This work presents a rule-based service customization strategy which employs a semantic distance-based rule matching method for context-aware service decision making and a Rough Set Theory-based rule generation method to supervise the service customization. The simulation study reveals the trend of the algorithms in time complexity with the number of rules and context items. A prototype smart home system is implemented based on smartphones and commercially available low-cost sensors and embedded electronics. Results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed strategy in handling the heterogeneous context for decision making and dealing with history context to discover the underlying rules.

abstract = {Using currently available infrastructure in pervasive environments it is possible to provide intelligent mechanisms that offer people help and guidance for organizing their daily activities. In this study, a framework providing such capabilities is proposed. This framework allows users to model their daily activities in the form of workflows, which are adaptable at run-time according to context information collected in pervasive environments. A workflow engine is used for modelling and management of workflows, while a separate rule engine with complex event processing (CEP) capability is incorporated into the framework for enhancing workflow adaptation and execution. The adaptation model in the framework allows for the modelling of activities in a hierarchical manner, from high level abstract activities to more detailed ones. An event-driven architecture (EDA) is utilized for loosely coupled interaction between the workflow engine and the rule engine, allowing these engines and other context sources to exchange data among themselves. Moreover, the EDA allows incorporation of context information into the workflow models without modifying the workflow language. A level of automation higher than the level supported by workflows is proposed by processing events in pervasive environments using CEP.

abstract = {Automated reconfiguration is one of the crucial tasks in telecommunication service composition. The first step in reconfiguration is the monitoring phase. The problem of monitoring and error detection frequently appears in different telecommunications architectures. This article describes the main components of the architecture for monitoring module in AUTO framework. The monitoring approach is based on semantic technologies and ITIL framework. Equally, this paper presents an analysis and comparison of two approaches for the implementation of the module: Drools and semantic formalism. The results of this study may be applicable to other telecommunication domains.},

abstract = {Implantable cardioverter defibrillators can generate numerous alerts. Automatically classifying these alerts according to their severity hinges on the CHA2DS2VASc score. It requires some reasoning capabilities for interpreting the patient's data. We compared two approaches for implementing the reasoning module. One is based on the Drools engine, and the other is based on semantic web formalisms. Both were valid approaches with correct performances. For a broader domain, their limitations are the number and complexity of Drools rules and the performances of ontology-based reasoning, which suggests using the ontology for automatically generating a part of the Drools rules.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe SP-ACT, a hybrid framework for the derivation of high-level activity interpretations in context-aware environments, by defining a combination of OWL ontologies and SPARQL CONSTRUCT graph patterns. More specifically, the native semantics of OWL is used to formally represent and integrate activity-related information originated from different data sources, whereas SPARQL (SPIN) rules further aggregate activities so as to derive highlevel activity abstractions. The goal of the hybrid framework is to address the limitations of the ontology-based context modelling paradigm in domains that require the recognition of complex context elements, namely, the lack of support for (i) temporal reasoning and (ii) new named individual assertions.},
